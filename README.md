üöÄ Work Experience:
During my role as a Software Development Intern at Neusoft Corporation, I was part of a dynamic team of 40 members, contributing to the design and development of an advanced intelligent navigation system. My work involved implementing cross-platform image format conversion and integrating Nuance Engine for precise human voice recognition. I also designed a versatile 'Voice Core' module, enhancing user interaction through context-aware vocal cues.

As a Software Engineer at Accenture Technology Solutions, I managed end-to-end quality assurance for an entire project. I successfully integrated Agile methodologies, Jira, and Postman for streamlined communication, conducted client updates, and orchestrated software deployments. I also developed real-time alerting and data analysis visualization for an automated testing platform, significantly improving issue detection and testing efficiency.

My experience as a Teaching Assistant at Johns Hopkins University's Center for Talented Youth allowed me to lead self-sustained classes and deliver engaging lectures on Data Structures and Algorithms. I collaborated on developing Java and JavaScript web application labs, achieving a 100% student attendance rate and enhancing the learning experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Highlights:

Web Application: Online Order System - Designed and developed a fullstack web application enabling seamless food ordering using Java Spring Boot, MyBatisPlus, and Vue.js. Applied AJAX for real-time updates and enhanced performance with SpringCache and Sharding-JDBC.

Web Application: Community System - Created a dynamic community platform using Spring Boot and MyBatisPlus, implementing real-time chat, post creation, and authentication. Utilized Redis, ThreadLocal, and Caffeine to optimize user experiences.
